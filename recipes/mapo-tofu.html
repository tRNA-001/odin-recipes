        Mapo Tofu is a popular Chinese dish from Sichuan Province, 
        where spicy food is king and the signature spice of the region 
        - the Sichuan Peppercorn - gives dishes a unique “numbing” effect. 
        It’s almost like the Sichuan peppercorns are there to not only add 
        their fragrance and flavor, but also to numb your tongue so it can 
        take more heat!
    </p>
    <p>
        The name of the dish roughly translates to “pockmarked grandma’s tofu.” 
        Whatever its origins, mapo tofu has made it out of Sichuan Province and 
        spread around the world. The dish has taken on many forms as restaurants 
        and takeout joints have put their own spin on it, often lessening spice 
        levels, adding different vegetables, and transforming the dish into 
        something else entirely!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup oil</li>
        <li>1-2 fresh Thai bird chili peppers</li>
        <li>6-8 dried red chilies</li>
        <li>1/2 - 1 1/2 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns</li>
        <li>3 tbsp ginger</li>
        <li>3 tbsp garlic</li>
        <li>8 oz ground pork</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp spicy bean sauce</li>
        <li>2/3 cup low sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 lb silken tofu</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 scallion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                First, we toast the chilies. If you have homemade toasted chili oil, 
                you can skip this step. Heat your wok or a small saucepan over low heat. 
                Add half of the oil and throw in the fresh and dried peppers. Stir occasionally 
                and heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes, ensuring that the peppers don’t burn. 
                Remove from heat and set aside.
            </p>
        </li>

                Heat the remaining half of the oil in your wok over medium heat. 
                Add the ginger. After 1 minute, add the garlic. Fry for another minute, and 
                then turn up the heat to high and add the ground pork. Break up the meat and fry 
                it until it’s cooked through. Add your ground Sichuan peppercorns and stir for 
                about 15-30 seconds, taking care to not let it burn, as it will turn bitter if it does.
            </p>
        </li>

                Add the spicy bean sauce to the mixture and stir it in well. Add the chicken broth 
                to the wok and stir. Let this simmer for a minute or so. While that's happening, ready your 
                tofu and combine the water and cornstarch in a small bowl.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Add the cornstarch mixture to your sauce and stir. Let it bubble away until the sauce starts to 
                thicken. (If it gets too thick, splash in a little more water or chicken stock.)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Then add your chili oil from before—peppers and all! If you are using homemade chili oil, ONLY 
                use the standing oil, as it's likely that you have salted it and you only want the oil, not additional salt. 
                Stir the oil into the sauce, and add the tofu. Use your spatula to gently toss the tofu in the sauce. 
                Let everything cook for 3-5 minutes. Add the sesame oil and sugar (if using) along with the scallions and stir
                 until the scallions are just wilted.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Serve with a last sprinkle of Sichuan peppercorn powder as a garnish if desired.
