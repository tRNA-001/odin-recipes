        Of the many soups and stews that proliferate Filipino cuisine, it can be sure that sinigang 
        has no rival. Many meals, both in childhood and adulthood, have been spent sitting in front of 
        the familiarly flavorful broth. Its inviting aroma belies a flavor unlike no other — tart, savory, 
        and refreshing, one can’t help but fall in love with it! With many heralding it as the national 
        Filipino food, it comes as no surprise that its reputation has spread far and wide across the world.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Extract the flavors from tamarind by boiling them in 2 quarts of water
                for 40 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the solid parts of tamarind by using a strainer.
                Squeeze the tamarind into the strainer to extract more flavor.
            </p>

                Pour the tamarind broth into a pot and boil. Then add the pork belly and cover to boil.
                Skim-off the floating parts of the mixture. Add fish sauce to taste. 
                Cover and simmer until the pork belly becomes tender. This can take between 45 to 90
                minutes depending on the quality of the meat.

                Add the daikon radish and eggplants. Simmer in low heat for 5 minutes.
                Then add long green chili, string beans, and all other remaining vegetables
                except the water spinach.
                Simmer for another 3 minutes.

                Add the stalks of water spinach and season the dish with fish sauce and black pepper.
                After 2 minutes, add the water spinach leaves. Cover and turn the heat off. The leaves 
                will be cooked with the residual heat in the pot. Serve after 3 to 5 minutes and enjoy!
